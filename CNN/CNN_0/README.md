## **Learning goals:** 

1.   To get introduced with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
2.   To start working with image data.
3.   To train and test a CNN model for a multiclass classification task with PyTorch.


Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): are similar to ordinary neural networks.
They are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases.
The main difference is that CNNS mainly work on image data and apply the so called convolutional filters:
A typical CNN archtecture looks like the following?

It has:

Different convolutional layers.
Optional activation fucntions followed by Pooling layers.
lastely one or more fully connected layers
